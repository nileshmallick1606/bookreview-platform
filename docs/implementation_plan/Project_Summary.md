|-------|-------------|----------|------------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | Setup & Infrastructure | 1 week | Sep 3, 2025 | Sep 9, 2025 | 15 | 52 |
| 2 | Core Features | 2 weeks | Sep 10, 2025 | Sep 23, 2025 | 34 | 97 |
| 3 | Advanced Features | 2 weeks | Sep 24, 2025 | Oct 7, 2025 | 25 | 79 |
| 4 | Testing & Deployment | 1 week | Oct 8, 2025 | Oct 14, 2025 | 32 | 105 |
| **Total** | | **6 weeks** | | | **106** | **333** |

## Resource Allocation

### Team Composition

- 1 Frontend Developer
- 1 Backend Developer
- 1 DevOps Engineer (part-time)
- 1 Project Manager / Engineering Manager (oversight)

### Effort Distribution by Role

| Role | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Phase 4 | Total Hours |
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Frontend Developer | 26 | 50 | 31 | 0 | 107 |
| Backend Developer | 26 | 47 | 48 | 46 | 167 |
| DevOps Engineer | 0 | 0 | 0 | 59 | 59 |
| **Total** | **52** | **97** | **79** | **105** | **333** |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| OpenAI API integration challenges | Medium | Medium | Develop robust fallback mechanism using top-rated books |
| File-based storage performance | Medium | High | Implement efficient indexing; limit scope of queries |
| Testing coverage targets not met | Medium | High | Allocate buffer time; prioritize critical path testing |
| Resource constraints | Low | Medium | Clear prioritization of features; consider scope reduction if needed |

## Critical Path

1. Project setup and authentication system (Phase 1)
2. Book and review core functionality (Phase 2)
3. Rating aggregation system (Phase 3)
4. Testing and deployment infrastructure (Phase 4)

## Key Success Metrics

1. All user stories implemented with acceptance criteria met
2. Backend test coverage exceeds 80%
3. Successful deployment with automated CI/CD pipeline
4. File-based data storage performs adequately for the expected load

## Next Steps

1. Team onboarding and kickoff meeting
2. Development environment setup
3. Sprint planning for Phase 1
4. Regular progress reviews and adjustments

## Approval

This implementation plan requires approval from key stakeholders before development begins.
