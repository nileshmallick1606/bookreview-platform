# User Story 4.4: CI/CD Pipeline

**Phase:** 4 - Testing & Deployment
**As a developer, I want to set up CI/CD pipelines so that code is automatically tested and deployed.**

## Acceptance Criteria:
- CI pipeline runs tests on each pull request
- CD pipeline deploys to staging after successful merge
- CD pipeline deploys to production with manual approval
- Pipeline status is visible in the repository
- Notifications are sent for pipeline failures
- Rollback mechanism is available for failed deployments

## Story Points: 8
